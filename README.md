# Revenue Metrics Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Revenue Metrics Dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive tool for analyzing financial inflows within the project. This dashboard is designed to empower product managers with insights into the dynamics of financial changes and facilitate high-level analysis of the factors influencing these changes.

## Key Metrics Included
The dashboard includes the following key metrics:
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: Monthly revenue from recurring subscriptions.
- **Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU)**: Average revenue generated per paying user.
- **New Paid Users**: Count of users who started paying within a specific period.
- **New MRR**: MRR generated by users who became paying customers in a given month.
- **Churned Users**: Number of users who stopped paying within a specific time frame.
- **Churn Rate**: Ratio of churned users in the target period to paid users in the previous period.
- **Churned Revenue**: Cumulative revenue from all users who stopped paying in the previous period.
- **Revenue Churn Rate**: Ratio of revenue from users who did not continue paying in the previous month to MRR from the previous month.
- **Expansion MRR**: Increase in MRR from users who paid more in the current month compared to the previous month.
- **Contraction MRR**: Decrease in MRR from users who paid less in the current month compared to the previous month.
- **Customer Lifetime (LT)**: Average time from the first payment to user churn.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: Average total revenue generated by a user over their entire usage period.

## Advanced Techniques and Approaches Used
The project leveraged advanced techniques in SQL and data visualization tools such as Tableau:
- **SQL Queries**: Utilized complex SQL queries to aggregate and compute metrics from the "games_payments" and "games_paid_users" tables in PostgreSQL.
- **Data Aggregation**: Employed SQL aggregations to calculate MRR, churn metrics, and customer lifetime metrics.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Created interactive dashboards using Tableau, incorporating table calculations and Level of Detail (LOD) expressions to visualize trends, distributions, and correlations.
- **Analytics Tools**: Applied analytics tools to visualize and interpret the data effectively, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
